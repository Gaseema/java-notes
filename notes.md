###java notes  
> Scanner class is found in java.util   
An argument is any extra information that the method needs in order to work.  
Scanner class is used for user input  
Use input.nextLine() to input strings.  
When working with classes, private variables are only accessible to the class attributes and methods.  
When one adds a return type e.g. String in a method declaration, it is mandatory to add a return statement of the same return type.  
System.out.printf("Your first gf was %s", getName()); ....%s points to the string variable declared in the class/ method.
String temp = input.nextLine()......takes whatever the user enters when prompted and stores in "temp"
